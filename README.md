# gocat

This is a very simple re-implementation of netcat in go. It lacks most of the features netcat offers. I made this mostly to teach myself new things about go and [reverse shells](https://blog.ropnop.com/upgrading-simple-shells-to-fully-interactive-ttys/).

Inspiration from [Hacking With Go](https://github.com/parsiya/Hacking-with-Go) and [Black Hat Python](https://github.com/WillPennell/Python/tree/master/Black-Hat-Python).
